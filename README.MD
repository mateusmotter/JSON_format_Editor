This project was built to complete a freelancing task found on Upwork.

Please, see requirements below: 

"I'm looking for someone to help me manipulate some JSON data into the format I need it. It's coming from a CSV, but I need to add some depth.

See the attachment for an example of the data I have and how I need it to look.

There are about 1300 rows in the CSV. I can provide that as JSON."


In order to achieve such result, I used nodeJS to run JavaScript locally and the "fs" library so I could parse the JSON documents into JavaScript objects. The formated values were then inserted into a new list of objects and then parsed into a json file again.

"function.js" is the logic that performs such task
"data.json" is the sample data used to test the code
"output.json" is the formatted file.
